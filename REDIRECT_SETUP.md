```
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev
```

## Supabase Configuration

2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
4. Set the Site URL to:
   ```
   https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev
   ```

### 2. Add Redirect URLs

In the same URL Configuration page, add the following Redirect URLs:

```
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev/signin
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev/signin?verified=true
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev/reset-password
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev/dashboard
https://agnel-booking-site.pages.dev/forgot-password
```

### 3. Save Changes

Click "Save" to apply these changes to your Supabase project.

## Testing Email Flows

After updating the configuration, test the following email flows:

1. **User Registration**: Sign up with a new email address and verify that the confirmation email contains the correct redirect URL.
2. **Password Reset**: Request a password reset and verify that the email contains the correct reset URL.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with redirects:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any CORS or redirect-related errors.
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure your production environment has the correct Supabase URL and API key.
3. **Check Supabase Logs**: Review the authentication logs in your Supabase dashboard for any errors.

## Local Development

For local development, the application automatically uses `http://localhost:5173` as the base URL for redirects. No additional configuration is needed for local testing.
